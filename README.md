# Getting Started
## Install dependencies
#### `composer install`

This script is going to install dependencies required to make this app work.

## Database configuration
When `composer install` finishes, open file .env and set your database configuration. In my case, I used MySQL with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html)

## Create database and seeders
Once you set up your database, we are going to create the databases required and seed it with fake users and one user that I set to test this app. So, open your terminal, make sure that you are in the app directory and type the next command:
#### `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed`

## Run the app
Open your terminal, make sure that you are in the app directory and type the next command to run the server:
#### `php artisan serve`

Your server address is [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## How it is work
Once you have the server running, follow the [Protest-test-frontend](https://github.com/jmrona/protected-test-frontend) instruction and when you see the login screen, use the `email: admin@admin.com` and `password: admin123` to sign in to the app

## More commands
To download a csv document with all users of the database use the command below:
#### `php artisan get:users`
